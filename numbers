FileInputStream and BufferedReader vs FileReader and BufferedReader
The difference between the two methods is how to construct a BufferedReader object. 
Method 1 uses InputStreamReader and Method 2 uses FileReader. What's the difference between 
the two classes? An InputStreamReader is a bridge from byte streams to character streams: 
It reads bytes and decodes them into characters using a specified charset. InputStreamReader 
can handle other input streams than files, such as network connections, classpath resources, 
ZIP files, etc.

FileReader is a convenience class for reading character files. The constructors of this class 
assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer size are appropriate. 
FileReader does not allow you to specify an encoding other than the platform default encoding. 
Therefore, it is not a good idea to use it if the program will run on systems with different 
platform encoding.
